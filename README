# Synergy_Config_Ansible
A group of ansible scripts produced on an account in DXC.technology for OneView in order to configure the Proof of Concept Synergy server

In this GitHub, it holds the structure of files in order for the Ansible playbooks to work.

NOTE: When wanting to use a specific playbook and run as a task, either copy the file or the code into the playbook within the 'Tasks' folder. IF copying the file into the Tasks folder, ensure the name is called "main.yml" otherwise Ansible will not read the file
When using Variables, ensure the variables file is also called 'main.yml' as, once again, Ansible will not read it
